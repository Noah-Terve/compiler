To just compile our compiler run:
    > `make`

Given a single source file written in your language, run your compiler on that file to generate
the executable and any intermediary files generated along the way.

To run our compiler on a source file written in our language, and generate all
intermediate files generated, run:
    > `./bin/compile.sh [.wam file] [executable name]`

To run all the tests and see the status of each, use:
    > `make test`
You can then see the test log in: `testall.log`

You can use also the `testall.sh` script for more fine-grain control. Running with
`-h` will give the help menu, where you can get more info. Running with no
options and no test files will test all of our cases. Specifying a test file
will run only that test.
    > `./testall.sh [options] [.wam files]`

Testing:
Our testing script validates that a program is correct by comparing the results
of running a test to a golden standard which we have created. For tests that are
supposed to pass they are .out files of the same name as the test. We validate
that a program that couldn't be compiled actually can't by comparing it to the
error that it is supposed to raise, which we have generated and stored in a
.err file. 

We have a whole set of files which test the various parts of our language we have
implemented so far. They are noted below and seperated out by the different
things they test. All these files are stored in the tests/exec directory or one
of its subdirectories

Number of failing tests: 5
Number of passing tests: 20

Basic print tests, all in:
/tests/exec/basic_print/
    test-print_int.wam - a simple file that prints 123
    fail-print_int.wam - a file that tries to call print but gives it a bad argument
    test-print_bool.wam - a simple file that prints out 1 for true and 0 for false
    test-print_char.wam - a simple file that prints out a character
    test-print_float.wam - a simple file that prints out a float
    test-print_string.wam - a simple file that prints out hello world

Basic Binop Literal Tests, all in:
/tests/exec/print-binop/
    test-print_alltypes.wam - a file that prints using all print function's of implemented types
    test-print_float_binop.wam - a file that prints out all binops using float literals
    test-print_float_int_arith.wam - a file that prints out float/int arithmetic
    test-print_int_binop.wam - a file that prints out all binops using int literals
    test-print_mod.wam - a file that prints out the mod binop

Basic Uop Literal Tests, all in:
/tests/exec/print-uop/
    test-print_uop.wam - a file that prints out all implemented types using uops

Templated function tests, all in:
/tests/exec/templated_functions/
    fail-nested_templates.wam - a templated function tries to access a template of an outer calling function
    fail-templated_function.wam - tries to make a call with a template as a type passed in when the template doesn't exist (i.e. the template isn't inside a template block)
    fail-wrong_number_of_args_for_template.wam - tries to make a call to a templated function but gives the wrong number of types to the template resolution
    test-basic_types.wam - test a templated function with all pairs of basic types and print the results
    test-nested_functions.wam - call a templated function from inside a templated function

Variable declaration and assignment, all in: 
/tests/exec/variable_dec_assign/
    test-dec-assign-in-block.wam - variable declaration and assignment in non-global scope
    test-dec-assign.wam - variable declaration and assignment in global scope
    test-dec-in-block.wam - variable declaration in non-global scope
    test-dec.wam - variable declaration in global scope


Variable Scope tests, all in:
/tests/exec/variable_scope
    fail-test-function-scope.wam - a function tries to use the local variables of the function that called it (not passed in as formal parameters)
    test-f-args.wam - updating environment within an expression e.g. `f(x = x + 1)`
    test-globals-in-blocks.wam - global variables should be accessible in all scopes


Things we still need to add to our compiler:
    Lists
    Sets
    Structs
    We don't enforce reachable returns right now
    enhanced for loops

Features added that MicroC doesn't have:
    Function templates
    Strings
    Characters
    Variable shadowing
    Variable declaration doesn't have to be at the top of a block
