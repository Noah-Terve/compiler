To just compile our compiler run:
    > `make`

To compile and execute our compiler you can run the following:
    > `dune exec toplevel [program_name]`

To run all the tests and see the status of each, use:
    > `make test`.

You can use the `testall.sh` script for more fine-grain control. Running with
`-h` will give the help menu, where you can get more info. Running with no
options and no test files will test all of our cases. Specifying a test file
will run only that test.
    > `./testall.sh [options] [.wam files]`

Things we still need to add to our compiler:
    As it stands our compiler prints statements first, then the functions and
    then the structs. This is purely an ordering issue, and will be resolved
    in the future.
