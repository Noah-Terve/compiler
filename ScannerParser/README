To compile and execute our compiler you can run the following:
    -> dune exec toplevel [program_name]

To just compile our compiler run:
    -> make

To run our test script you can run the following. Running with -h will give
the help list, and the .wam files are whatever files you want to test. Running
with no options and no test files will test all of our cases:
    -> ./testall.sh [options] [.wam files]

Things we still need to add to our compiler:
    As it stands our compiler prints statements first, then the functions and
    then the structs. This is purely an ordering issue, and will be resolved
    in the future.
